## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This application is no longer maintained and should be considered abandon-ware.

Please stop using this application.

Do not install this application unless you actually need this specific one.

There are three different migration paths away from this application:

1. Manually reset each TOTP account at the actual site and import the new setup into a different TOTP application.
1. For each account, use another device or computer to scan the account's QR code.
1. For each account, take a screenshot of the account's QR code, securely copy the screenshot to a computer and then scan them using a different TOTP application from the original device.

You can find these QR codes by tapping the circular account icon on any of the
individual account screens. The circular account icon changes into the QR code.
